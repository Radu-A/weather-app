- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **OpenWeather API** - Weather data provider
- **Framer Motion** - Animations (optional)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

---

## Features

- Dynamic weather icons based on API data
- Real-time city search with state management
- Conditional rendering for error handling and loading states
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

---

## Challenges & Learning

During development, I tackled several interesting challenges and learned key skills:

- **Tailwind CSS mastery:** Utility-first approach, responsive layouts, dynamic styling
- **State management in React:** Handling asynchronous API data
- **API calls:** Fetching and rendering data dynamically from OpenWeather
- **Conditional and dynamic rendering:** Showing different UI elements based on data or state
- **Search logic:** Implementing a real-time city search system

The **Tailwind documentation** was incredibly clear, complete, and a constant reference. The **OpenWeather API docs** were less clear and less detailed, but essential for understanding data structure and endpoints.
